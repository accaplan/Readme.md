# Hi!

I am originally an architect and urban designer who now works across mediums. I am new to web architecture and systems architecture, but use a similar process as when designing buildings or physical objects. That is a human-centered, handmade and process oriented approach.

I run a small creative studio where I do my own projects and am always looking for collaborations or freelance work.
