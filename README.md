# Hello!

I am an architect who works across mediums. I am new to web architecture and systems architecture, but use a similar process in designing buildings or physical objects. That is a human-centered approach and handmade and process oriented result.

I run a small creative studio where I do my own projects and am always looking for collaborations.
